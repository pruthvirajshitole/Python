#    Given the following 2D NumPy array:
#    arr = np.array([
#        [1, 2, 3, 4],
#        [5, 6, 7, 8],
#        [9, 10, 11, 12]
#    ])    
#    Extract a subarray containing the last two rows and first two columns. Then,
#    iterate over each element of this subarray and print the square of each element.

import numpy as np
# arr = np.array([
#        [1, 2, 3, 4],
#        [5, 6, 7, 8],
#        [9, 10, 11, 12]
#    ]) 
# for i in np.nditer(arr[1:,:2]):
#     print(i**2)


# 2. 3D Array Slicing & Modification  
#    Given the 3D array:  
   
#    arr = np.array([

#        [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]
#    ])
     
#    Slice and extract a 2D array containing only the second row of both 3D planes.
#    Modify this slice by adding 10 to each element and print both the original and modified arrays.  


arr = np.array([
       [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]],

#    Reshape it into a 3Ã—4 array and create a view of the reshaped array.
#    Modify the view by replacing all elements in the first row with `-1` and print both 
#    the original array and view. Explain the output.

#    - Append a new row `[70, 80, 90]` to the array.  
#    - Delete the second column from the updated array.  
#    - Insert a new column `[100, 110]` at index `1`.
