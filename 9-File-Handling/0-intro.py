File Handling in Python

File handling in Python is a crucial feature 
that allows developers to create, read, write, 
and manipulate files stored on a file system. 
Python provides built-in functions 
and modules for handling various file operations efficiently.

Opening a File:
    To work with files, Python provides the open() function. 
    The open() function takes two parameters; filename, and mode.
    It has the following syntax:

Common Modes:
- 'r': Read (default).
- 'w': Write (overwrites the file if it exists or creates a new one).
- 'x': Exclusive creation (fails if the file exists).
- 'a': Append (writes data to the end of the file).
- 'b': Binary mode.
- 't': Text mode (default).
- '+': Read and write.
