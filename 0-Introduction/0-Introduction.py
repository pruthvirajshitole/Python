'''
The of python is as follows:
concept :
     Dutch programmer Guido van Rossum conceived python in the late 1980s as
     a successor to the ABC programming language.

     Implementation:
        van Rossum began implementing Python in 1989 at Centrum wiskunde
        & Information (CWI) in the Netherlands.

    Naming:
        van Rossum named Python after the British comedy
        series Monty Python's Flying Ciecus.

Release:
       python was publicly released in 1994.
       Pyhton 2.0:
       Python 2.0 was released in Octomber 2000  and included
       new features like comprehensions, a garbage collecter, and Unicode support.

       
Van Rossum's departure:
              van Rossum announced his "permanent vacation" from his 
              role as Python's "benevoolent dictator for life"(BDFL)
              in july 2018. He has since come out of retirment 
              and is self-title "BDFL -emeritus".

Steering Council:
            In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a 
            five members Steering Council to lead the project.


Features of Python 

1.Easy to learn: 
     In Python : To print text 

     print("Hello World")

     In Java : to print text
            class A{
            public stativ void main  (String args[])}
            System.out.print("Hello world");


2.Interpreted Language
    Executes the code line by line.

3.High level programming language
    low level details can be abstracted(hidden)
    and developer can focus on the required functionality

4.Dynamically type:
    Statically typed(c,c++,java) /Dynamically typed(python),
    you don't need to define the type of data.

5.Object oriented:
    The concepts of creating Class and object supported in python

6.Extensive Standard Library:
    python have a rich Standard Library
    # pip install django

7.Platform Independent:
    Supports wins,linux,mac etc

8.Open Source:
    free to use

9.Garbage collection:
    Automatically handles memory management

10.Versatile Use case:
    Web dev, Ml, DS, DA, AI, Desktop app, mobile app, scripting, etc

11.Supports multiple Paradigm
    Object-oriented,
    functional programming,
    procedural programming

12-Integrates with language:
     like with C as Cython,
     with java as Jy
